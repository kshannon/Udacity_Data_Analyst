      <h1 align="center">Batting Lefty: Advantage?</h1>
      <p>In baseball not all is created equal. For example, left handed batters are able to see a right handed pitcher's hand and ascertain more info on what type of pitch may be coming. Left handed batters are also several feet closer to first base and after they swing at a ball their weight naturally carries them towards first base. Perhaps then left handed players might perform better due to these advantages..</p>

      <p>Clearly Right handed batters, which comprise 63.8% of batters from this data set, are the majority. However, in the general population studies suggest right handers account for approx 88-92%[1]. In our data set Left handers account for 27.3%, which is fairly higher compared to the population. We also see that Switch Hitters account for 8.9%, however in the population cross-dominance and true Ambidexterity account for 1% or less[2].</p>

      <p>This scatter plot shows the rough correlation between number of home runs and batting average for all 1157 players in the data set grouped by handedness. This chart makes it hard to tell if there is really and identifiable performance difference with regards to handedness. We can see that there is a cluster of right handed players that have lower batting average. There are many players with a .000 batting average; these are possibly American League pitchers. 

      Another observation is that left handed players and switch hitters have a potential similar pattern. Simply put, right handed players seem to have many more players under a .200 batting average. A dashed line is displayed at the .200 mark for easier viewing. There are not many lefties or switch hitters under .200, however there are significantly more right handed players in the data set. Percentage os players from their respective groups has been calculated in the batting average table below. Let's look at the two summary tables next. </p>

      <p>Because of the number of Zeros in the data set (presumable pitchers), the median might be to look at versus the mean. It seems that lefties have a dramatically higher number of home runs. Let's see if this trend also shows up in the batting average table next. </p>

      <p>Again, looking at the median, we can see a clear improvement in left handed player's batting average. The mean is certainly being dragged down by the large number of zeros present in the data set. One other finding to look at are the percentage of players under .200 batting avg. Note that these are not including players with a .000 batting avg. These numbers to show a significant difference between right (7.60%) and left (2.53%) handed players. Switch hitters did come in below right handed players as well, but it was much closer. It does seem from these percentages that a higher percentage of handed baseball players perform worse when it comes to batting average than lefties and possibly switch hitters.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <h4 align="left">Conclusion</h4>
      <p>The visuals presented about this sample MLB baseball data set seems to suggest that left handed players on average perform slightly better, or perhaps have an advantage over right handed players. This follows along the lines of conventional wisdom when it comes to baseball. I think more data would provide a better overview. For example having data showing on base percentage (OBP) and power (number of doubles, triples and home runs) would be more useful statistics compared to batting average and home runs. </p>
