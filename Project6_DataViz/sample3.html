      <h1 align="center">Batting Lefty: Advantage?</h1>
      <p>In baseball not all is created equal. For example, left handed batters are able to see a right handed pitcher's hand and ascertain more info on what type of pitch may be coming. Left handed batters are also several feet closer to first base and after they swing at a ball their weight naturally carries them towards first base. Perhaps then left handed players might perform better due to these advantages..</p>

      <p>Clearly Right handed batters, which comprise 63.8% of batters from this data set, are the majority. However, in the general population studies suggest right handers account for approx 88-92%[1]. In our data set Left handers account for 27.3%, which is fairly higher compared to the population. We also see that Switch Hitters account for 8.9%, however in the population cross-dominance and true Ambidexterity account for 1% or less[2].</p>
