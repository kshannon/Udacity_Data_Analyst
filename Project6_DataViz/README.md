Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

My visualization looks at a Major League Baseball data set and identifies some trends that have to do with handedness, e.g. left vs right hand. It is important to note that the MLB has a higher number of lefties and ambidextrous batters than the general population. There is a significant amount of players with zero home runs and a zero (0.000) batting average, these are most likely American League Pitchers. The visuals and data summary seem to suggest that there is def a difference in performance between lefties and righties in the MLB, this follows conventional wisdom and matches up with what other sources have reported on the issue.

Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

I wanted to implement a bar chart and scatter plot in my visual. I set out to use a bar chart, though probably verbose, to show the number of players grouped by handedness. A scatter plot was a perfect opportunity to look at relationships between Home runs and batting average. An interesting find was that almost no lefties dropped below the .200 batting average. Some feedback I received suggested that I make the scatterplot more interactive and either include an alpha for the individual points, or allow the user to hide data based on handedness. I decided to include an interaction that allowed a user to hide data. This made it easier to reveal the true scatter plot shape for each handedness group.

Another change I made was to add tables with summary statistics to show how each handedness compared to each other with respect to one dimension of data. This was good, because the scatterplot does not do the best job showing that lefties were more likely to have more home runs and better batting averages. This was a good suggestion.
