Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

My visualization looks at a Major League Baseball data set and identifies some trends that have to do with handedness, e.g. left vs right hand. It is important to note that the MLB has a higher number of lefties and ambidextrious batters than the general population. 

Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

Resources - list any sources you consulted to create your visualization
