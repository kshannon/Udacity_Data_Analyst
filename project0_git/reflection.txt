Kyle Shannon - Udacity Notes/Reflection for Git Course

Question 1: Thoughts on diff for file compare?
 - Diff was much faster because it only showed you the difference between both files.
 - Also, It showed you both the old and new file text next to each other. Very useful.
Question 2: How does having access to all version make you a better/more efficient programmer?
 - You can learn from your mistakes and review your logical process with your self and collegues.
 - You can roll back if you frak something up and break your project/code and cannot get back easily. Rolling back makes you faster and makes it easier ot try things out.  
Question 3: Pros/Cons of manually choosing when to create a commit?
 - Logic follows decision. E.g. you can commit after a series of small related changes, or after one large function refactor, etc.
 - I would think the correlation between time and need for commit is low.
Question 4: Why Git allows saving N files in one Commit?
 - Because programmers usually work on projects that involve multiple files, or work collaboratively. 
Question 5: How does git diff and git log allow you to view the file's history?
 - Log allows you to see the sequences os changes from a high level that you have done. Sort of like a timeline.
 - Diff provides you a detailed look into what exact changes, line by line, you have done with each file.
