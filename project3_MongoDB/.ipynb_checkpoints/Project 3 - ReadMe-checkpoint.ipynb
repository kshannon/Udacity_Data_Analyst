    "There are many exciting questions you can ask and ways to make use of such rich data. I would recommend taking a closer look at the  'bicycle_parking' amenity. The first interesting thing to note is that bike_parking is the 2nd most numerous amenity after car parking. I was not sure how bike friendly Seattle would be, especially due to the number of days it rains. Lets say we have a client that wants to set up mobile repair/snack bike shops and they obviously want to target cyclists that are in need of repair. They also want to be able to travel along frequented bike paths and know the landscape of competitive brick and mortar bike shops. Here is what I would suggest to such a client:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a look at the bike data we currently have and web scrape to fill in potential holes. Look for additional bike parking locations, well-known bike paths and bike shops. Add missing ones to the database.\n",
    "- Next we could use postcodes, or using long/lat, create a heatmap of bike paths, parking and shops over the city of Seattle. \n",
    "- Look for any trends in the data, perhaps there are a few large bike paths that have many bike parking areas around it and a few bike shops in close proximity.\n",
    "- Suggest that sticking to these paths might produce the most positive customer interactions/transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the .osm data is not very granular and would be difficult to extend to such a specific client problem. However, I believe it does provide a good backbone from which we can add more specific cyclist related data. Then from a more complete data set, we could provide better predictions and cyclist insight. The strength of the .osm data set is in its generality. Once you have it, it can be used in many ways. Perhaps cyclists frequent cafes after their morning ride? Well guess what we have lots of data on the placement of cafes. What cafes are close to bike paths? Then we can go online, or even call the cafe shops and ask if it’s a hot spot for cyclists. The point is that we can use this general dataset to drill down into the bedrock of our questions and provide guidance on where to focus our efforts.\n",

    "Seattle was a fairly clean data set, especially street names. There was some standardizing that occurred for road types, and I programmatically removed data not in US, Seattle, and Seattle's zipcode list. I also removed data that were flagged as 'fixme' because that tag symbolized to me incomplete data. I did most of the data removal/changing in the parsing stage and used grep + db querying to discover insight about the data set. Obviously there are many questions and projects one could tackle with a cleaned open street map data set. I choose to focus effort of cafes, bike amenities and I also checked out restaurants. There were a surprising number of mexican restaurants. Upon further investigation I found that over 1/3 of them were taco bells!"
