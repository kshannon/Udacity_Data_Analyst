The test is a dependant t - test because both congruent and incongruent tests were given to each subject.The choice for a one sided test is due to the hypothesis of the difference of the means. Congruent words require less cortical processing power to accuretly read. Accuretly reading Incongruent words requires subjects' to use more neural systems, e.g. the anterior cingulate cortex. If more brain systems are being used, the laws of electrophysiology tell us that computing time must increase. Therefore, we choose to only care about an increase in the mean time for the task."
